# CryptoClustering

## Description

This project aims to analyze cryptocurrency market data using clustering techniques. It includes preprocessing steps, feature scaling, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and clustering using K-Means. The goal is to understand the structure of the cryptocurrency market and identify meaningful clusters of cryptocurrencies.

## Files

- `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data analysis and clustering.
- `crypto_market_data.csv`: Dataset containing cryptocurrency market data.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- holoviews

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

` https://github.com/matiassiad/CryptoClustering.git `

2. Navigate to the project directory:

` cd Crypto_Clustering ` 

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` to execute the code and analyze the cryptocurrency market data.

## Details and Work Done
- Preprocessed the cryptocurrency market data to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
- Applied feature scaling to standardize the numerical features.
- Performed dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features.
- Implemented K-Means clustering algorithm to identify clusters in the data.
- Visualized the results of clustering using various plots and charts.
- Conducted an elbow method analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.
